# Atlas VM records

An Atlas VM record identifies a tenant resource and reserves a host. Metal uses the same stable VM ID for host execution and retries.

## Create and confirm a record

Atlas commits the record as a draft before it calls Metal. The draft holds the host reservation while Atlas checks an uncertain response. [How a VM request works](../start/how-a-vm-request-works.md) explains when Atlas confirms or removes it.

## Change VM resources

Atlas sends complete desired compute, disk, network, metadata, and SSH key values.

[SSH key changes](ssh-keys.md) use Firecracker metadata and the guest's login command. The VM image does not need to be rebuilt for a key change.

CPU uses `cpu_millicores`: **1000 equals one core**. The range is `100` through `32000`, avoiding impractical quotas and respecting Firecracker's 32-vCPU maximum.

## Read current VM state

| Data | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Request, host, image, architecture, tenant, resources | Atlas VM record. |
| Current guest state, routes, host error | Metal, read when document properties need them. |
| VM list state | `Virtual Machine State`, cached from host sync. |

The cache can be stale after failed sync. Compare Metal's desired and observed generations for operation progress.

## Terminate or move a VM

Termination retains the Atlas record while Metal cleans up. Atlas removes it only after Metal confirms absence.

Resize stays on the current host if capacity permits. Otherwise, Atlas reserves a destination and creates a [migration record](migration.md).

## Guest metadata

Atlas sends custom metadata as a map of string keys and values. Metal publishes it at `latest/meta-data/attributes` in Firecracker's microVM Metadata Service (MMDS). A change replaces the complete map.

| Value | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Custom metadata | Atlas accepts at most 16 entries and 48 KiB of JSON. |
| Custom metadata key | Metal accepts at most 128 bytes. |
| SSH keys | Metal accepts at most 16 keys, each at most 2 KiB. |
| User data | Metal accepts at most 16 KiB. |
| Hostname | Metal accepts at most 253 bytes. |
| MMDS document | Metal sets the Firecracker MMDS limit to 256 KiB. Metal keeps the base document within 248 KiB and reserves 8 KiB for temporary console keys. |

Metal checks the complete MMDS document before it saves a create, network, SSH key, or metadata change. See [SSH key changes](ssh-keys.md) for the guest login path.

## Open the console

VM read access permits a console request. [Open a VM console](console.md) explains the token, realtime bridge, and two guest modes.

## Limits and recovery

Keep an uncertain draft if the host cannot be reached. Check current Metal state before retrying a change. The Atlas list alone is insufficient.
