# Set up development

Use this guide to choose the smallest environment for your change. Atlas app work needs a Frappe site. Metal and WG Mesh work needs Linux host features.

::: warning Local setup is a work in progress
The local setup guides are not fully verified. Steps can be incomplete or change. Ask the team if a step does not work.
:::

If this is your first change, read [how a VM request works](../start/how-a-vm-request-works.md). Then use the [code map](code-map.md) to find the owner and its tests. Choose a setup below for that owner.

## Follow a change through the system

1. Read the topic's handbook page to learn the request path, saved state, and failure path. The [architecture](../start/architecture.md) shows which component owns each part.
2. Use the [code map](code-map.md) to find the owner, its nearby `SPEC.md`, and the first test to read.
3. Follow the input from its API or job to the saved record and the worker that applies it. For example, the [firewall guide](../networking/host-networking.md#how-metal-applies-a-firewall-change) follows a network request to the host rule update.
4. Change the owning component and run its focused tests. Use host tests when Linux, ZFS, KVM, or packet behavior matters. Update the authoritative handbook page when behavior changes.

## Choose an environment

| Work | Start here | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Atlas app, DocTypes, and placement | [Atlas development](atlas-app.md) | Frappe, MariaDB, Redis, and a site |
| Metal code and VM runtime | [Metal development](metal.md) | Go and Linux host tools |
| Metal integration tests | [Metal testing](metal-testing.md) | Linux, root, KVM, ZFS, systemd, and iptables |
| HTTP proxy | [Proxy development](http-proxy.md) | Python 3.14 and OpenResty test tools |
| WG Mesh | [WG Mesh development](wg-mesh.md) | Linux, Go, Clang, libbpf, and a test host for packet checks |
| IPv6 router | [Router design](../networking/ipv6-router.md) and [specification](../../services/ipv6-router/SPEC.md) | Clang and a gateway VM for live checks |

## Run documentation locally

Install the Node dependencies, then start the VitePress server:

```sh
npm install
npm run docs:dev
```

Build the site before you open a pull request:

```sh
npm run docs:build
```

VitePress reads Markdown from the repository. Do not edit `.vitepress/dist` by hand.

## Write documentation

Explain behavior, reasons, and recovery once in the matching handbook section under `docs/`. Keep code contracts in a nearby `SPEC.md` and link to the handbook. A short `README.md` can link to both.

Put a new page in reading order in `.vitepress/sidebar.mts`. Keep source-code links in a `details` block at the end of the page. The `docs-build/internal/` files are background research and are excluded from the site.

## Before you submit a change

- Read the nearest component `SPEC.md` before a structural change.
- Run the formatter and focused tests for the component.
- Run `npm run docs:build` when you change documentation or the VitePress configuration.
- Keep each page focused on one reader task.
