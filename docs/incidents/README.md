# Incidents

This folder holds one report for each production or staging incident. A report states the impact, the timeline, the root cause, the fix, and the lessons.

A person files each report. An agent can suggest a report, but it must not add one unless a person asks. A filed report is immutable. Do not edit it. Record only incidents in a deployed environment, such as production or staging. Do not record local development issues.
